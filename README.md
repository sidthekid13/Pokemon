# Pokemon Database

Welcome to Pokemon Database. I have created this project for the Flatiron School full-time software engineering bootcamp. This project provides a list of pokemon from an external source and allows the user to select a pokemon from the list and then find out their ability, or select another pokemon. 

# Installation

After cloning this repo to your local computer, you can use the link below to see a tutorial on how it is done. 

https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Then, install these gems listed below: 

```
gem install pry
```
```
gem install json
```
```
gem install rest-client
```

# How To Run The Program

-After cloning and opening the Repo on your local computer, enter ```ruby bin/poke``` in your terminal

-In the terminal it will prompt you to select a number for a pokemon

-Type a number from 1 to 20 into the terminal

-In the terminal it will return the pokemon that you have selected and their ability

-Next the program will ask if you would like to look at another pokemon and instruct you to either input "yes" or "no" into the terminal.

-You can select as many pokemon as you would like to look at and then simply input "no" to exit out of the API
